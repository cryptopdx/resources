# Contributing Guidelines

## Code of Conduct

This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration. All contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/) code of conduct. Thank you for being kind to each other!

## Contributions welcome!

**Before spending lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!**

Please search [issues](../../issues/) and [pull requests](../../pulls/) before adding something new! This helps avoid duplicating efforts and conversations.

This project welcomes any kind of contribution! Here are a few suggestions:

- **Ideas**: participate in an issue thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
- **Writing**: contribute your expertise in an area by helping expand the included content.
- **Copy editing**: fix typos, clarify language, and generally improve the quality of the content.
- **Formatting**: help keep content easy to read with consistent formatting.

## Project Governance

**This is an [OPEN Open Source Project](http://openopensource.org/).**

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.
